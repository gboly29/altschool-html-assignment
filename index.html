      <p>
        I'm Gbolahan Balogun, a Frontend software engineering in the making,
        passionate about changing the world through web development. I have a
        Bsc degree in psychology but recently quit my job to focus fully on a
        career path in frontend engineering. i'm meticulous in my approach to
        reasearch, i'm innovative and a self-learner. I have a good foundation
        in programing languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React which as
        helped me alot in navigating ALTSchool(school of software engineering).
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming to ALTSchool I hope to solidify and improve my basic knowledge as
        a frontend engineer, meet alot of interesting people who are aspiring to
        become a frontend engineers and hopefully at the end of ALTSchool,
        build/join a community who can impact and change the world. My greatest
        achievement will be to conquer ALTSchool and the tech world at large.
